#|Exercise 3.11: sum-of-odds
It can be shown that the sum of the first n odd numbers is equal to n^2.
For example,
                 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 = 4^2

Write a procedure sum-of-odds that sums the first n odd integers. Test your
procedure by evaluating it for all values of n from 1 to 10 to see that each
is the perfect square of the number of terms.|#
