#|Exercise 2.25
Write a trace similar to the one used in remove-1st-trace to trace the procedure swapper, showing
the binding of the parameter Is each time the cond expression is entered and whenever a cond clause
is exited. Invoke the traced procedure swapper-trace on the arguments b, d, and (a b c d b) used in
the example in this section.|#
